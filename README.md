# CloseAll Expert Advisor

CloseAll is an expert advisor for MetaTrader 5 that closes open positions based on specified profit and loss targets, as well as a specified closing time. This expert advisor is suitable for traders who want to automate the process of closing positions at specific levels of profit or loss, or at a specific time.

## Features

- Close positions based on profit target: Specify the desired profit target in points, and the expert advisor will close any open positions that have reached or exceeded this target.
- Close positions based on loss target: Specify the desired loss target in points, and the expert advisor will close any open positions that have reached or exceeded this target.
- Close all positions at a specific time: Specify the closing time in HH:MM format, and the expert advisor will close all remaining open positions at or after this time.

## How it Works

1. The expert advisor first initializes by setting the closing time, profit target, and loss target.
2. It calculates the closing time in seconds based on the current day and the specified closing time.
3. It iterates through all open positions using a for loop.
4. For each open position, it calculates the profit/loss in points.
5. If the profit or loss target is reached, it closes the position using the PositionClose function.
6. After checking all open positions, it checks if the current time is greater than or equal to the closing time.
7. If the closing time is reached, it iterates through all remaining open positions and closes them.

## Product Description

The CloseAll expert advisor is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of closing positions in your MetaTrader 5 trading platform. With this expert advisor, you can automate the closing of positions based on specific profit and loss targets, as well as a specific closing time.

By setting a profit target, you can ensure that profitable positions are closed automatically when they reach or exceed the desired level of profit. This helps you lock in your gains and avoid potential reversals that could result in a loss.

Similarly, by setting a loss target, you can protect your account from excessive losses. The expert advisor will close any positions that have reached or exceeded the specified loss target, helping you limit your risk and preserve your capital.

Additionally, the expert advisor allows you to set a specific closing time. This is particularly useful for traders who want to close all their positions at the end of the trading day or at a specific time when they are no longer available to monitor the market. This feature ensures that all positions are closed automatically, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
